# Android assessment

Build a small news application using https://newsapi.org
- I would like to see a list of the top headlines for the Netherlands.
- The list should display the headline and the image.
- In addition when I tap a news item I would like another screen to open displaying the image, headline, full content and a link to the original article (Open in browser).
- The list should display a “new" indicator on items I have not opened yet. Once I click an article the indicator should disappear. For this assessment we don’t require persistence on closing the app. A memory storage will suffice. However it would be nice if you can explain to us how you would implement this in your architecture.

Scoring is based on:
- Are all functional requirements fulfilled?
- Your approach to architecture using the Android architecture components.
- Clean code following SOLID principles.
- Build 1 automated test for 1 function/component (the view model for example). For time constraints only 1 unit test will suffice however we do want to see how you approach this so make it count!
- I can checkout the project, build and run it on a device without any issues.

For bonus points:
- An eye for design is important for front end work so make it look presentable.
- Adding some nice animation on opening an article.

Some pointers:
- Only use commonly used libraries (Koin, Retrofit, glide, etc.)
- Keep things as simple as possible. Less is more.
- Put you finished project on a public git repository and send us the link.


Scoring list:
- Use of architecture components
- All requirements fulfilled
- Dependency injection used correctly
- Views setup correctly
- Code is clean and readable
- Are the viewmodels and repositories testable
- Is the unit test well written
